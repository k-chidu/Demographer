PROJECT NAME   :	Demographer
TEAM NAME      :	PACH Team
CLASS          :	12 A9
DESCRIPTION    :	Predict population with previous years data of population

CONCEPTS USED  :    	1. GUI 		- 	Tkinter
			2. Storing data 	- 	MySQL.Connector (module)
			3. Logic		- 	linear regression


WORKING:
	1. We have saved the previous population data of each state in India before-hand into sql database.
	
	2. User is required to select the state he/she wants to predict population for.

	3. User is free to choose state name, year and total or male or female population.

	4. After selecting, the previous years population runs into the linear regression program.

	5. The linear regression function finds slope and intercept for a curve approximately representing population growth.

	6. With slope and intercept, substituting in linear equation, we get approximate population values.

	7. The values are show as output with a pie-chart for better understanding.


TO VIEW THE SAVED DATA:

	1. Select database button in homepage.
	2. user and passwd is 'admin'.
	3. And respective state's stored data can be viewed.
  	
	NOTE: Multiplying factor for the values stored in sql is 1000.
